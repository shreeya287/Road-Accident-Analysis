This project involves a comprehensive analysis of road accidents using MS Excel. By leveraging Excel's powerful data processing and visualization tools, we have explored various factors contributing to road accidents. Our analysis includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and the creation of informative charts and graphs to identify trends and patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help in formulating effective strategies for accident prevention and road safety improvements. The repository includes the dataset, Excel files with analysis, and detailed documentation to facilitate understanding and replication of the study.
